  abstract = {Abalone is a two-player abstract strategy board game designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent L\'evi in 1987. Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent's marbles off the edge of the board. Abalone was published in 1990 and has sold more than 4.5 million units. The year it was published it received one of the first Mensa Select awards. It is currently sold in more than thirty countries.},

  abstract = {Forming winning strategies for board games requires good heuristics and fast search algorithms on game trees. High branching factors and the need for looking deeper in game trees are overwhelming, even for today's high performance PC's. Therefore, better game-plays are only available with better algorithms and heuristics for an ordinary player, not with faster machines. Abalone is a recent two-person strategy game. Initial evaluations point out that the branching factor is larger than the chess. In this paper, a new heuristic used by a simple intelligent agent for playing Abalone game, named as ABLA is introduced. ABLA's performance is promising as compared to existing computerized Abalone players.},
